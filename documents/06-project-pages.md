# Project Pages (publishing conventions)

This document summarizes the project-pages publishing conventions that a
project started from this skeleton adopts. The canonical, authoritative
description lives in the homelab project:
`documents/09-project-pages-conventions.md`. This document is the skeleton's
summary of it and points back to the canonical source.

## Why pages exist

A project's published pages are its **read interface**: status, live state,
work plan (TODO), rules (prompts), and knowledge (documents). A human or LLM
can understand the project — and decide how to work with it — without
escaping the project's sandbox.

## The standard page set

A project publishes a directory tree served at `/projects/<id>/`, with a
consistent relative nav. Every page is required:

| Page | Content |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | **Status**: what the project is, its current status, how it works. |
| `dashboard.html` | **Dashboard**: live state (point-in-time values from the owning host). |
| `todo.html` | **Condensed TODO**: open work items. |
| `prompts.html` | **Prompts index**: the entire `prompts/` tree, grouped by directory, linking to full-text pages. |
| `documents.html` | **Documents index**: every file in `documents/`, linking to full-text pages. |
| `records.html` | **Records index**: every file in `records/`, linking to full-text pages. |

Rules:

- The generated pages (`todo.html`, `prompts.html`, `documents.html`,
  `records.html`) are **generated at build time** from the project's own
  files — never hand-maintained. The generator is `scripts/site-condense.sh`,
  wired into `make site` alongside `scripts/site-build.sh`.
- **Every `.md` file under `prompts/` (the entire tree), `documents/`, and
  `records/` is published as its own full-text page** (e.g.
  `prompts-common-02-universal-rules.html`), linked from the index pages.
  Markdown is rendered with pandoc when available (minimal fallback
  otherwise).
- `todo.html` stays condensed: open items with their continuation text,
  completed items summarized as a count.
- **Relative links only**, so the pages work at any depth under
  `/projects/<id>/`.
- **The nav carries a link back to the labs home**, injected by the homelab
  at publish time: the template's nav includes the marker
  `<!-- HOMELAB-HOME-LINK -->`, which the homelab replaces with the actual
  home link when it fetches the tree. Projects never hardcode the labs site
  URL.
- Pages are self-contained (their own `<style>`/nav); the reference template
  is `site.in/template.html`.
- Recommended: a footer line linking back to `../` and naming the project.
- Generated output (`site.out/`) is gitignored; only `site.in/` is authored.

## Registration and publishing (homelab model)

- The project **registers once** in the homelab project's
  `sources/projects.yaml` (fields: `id`, `title`, `summary`, `status`,
  `visibility`, `self_published: true`, `pages_source`).
- **Activity vs phase** (owner 2026-08-26): the registry `status`
  (active/planned/deferred/complete) is the human-declared **activity**,
  in the single common homelab. The project's **phase** belongs to this
  project: declare it in `PHASES.md` (`Current: phase N — state`), change
  it only when committing the project, and let `scripts/site-condense.sh`
  emit `site.out/phase.txt` so the homelab can show "active · phase N
  started" on the projects page.
- `pages_source` tells the homelab how to read the project's generated tree:
  a path (`site.out/`, local or SSHFS) or an ssh command that streams the
  tree.
- **The homelab project is the only publisher.** It fetches every registered
  `pages_source`, runs the leak gate, and publishes with its own deploy.
  Projects do **not** push to the web server themselves — a project's
  `make deploy` is retired and only reminds you of this.
- Live-state freshness: the project refreshes its own state (`make state`,
  run on the owning host for hardware/network values) before the homelab
  publishes.

## Sanitization (non-negotiable)

Published pages must contain no MAC addresses, private LAN IPs, usernames,
home paths, or private-key material. The exact gate patterns live in the
homelab (`scripts/labs-deploy.sh`, `tests/03-labs-site.sh`,
`tests/06-project-pages.sh`); the homelab re-runs the gate at publish time.

## Conformance checklist

1. Read the canonical conventions doc in the homelab.
2. Generate the standard page set per the rules above (the skeleton's
   `site.in/` + `scripts/site-build.sh` + `scripts/site-condense.sh` +
   `make site` produce it).
3. Register once in the homelab `sources/projects.yaml` with a readable
   `pages_source`.
4. Confirm the leak gate passes over the generated output.
5. After a homelab deploy, verify
   `curl https://labs.bannister.us/projects/<id>/` returns 200 and the
   content is sanitized.

## Live example

- `amd-mi25-fan-service` (SSHFS at `~/remote/beast.lan/work/...`) and
  `model-elevation-earth` (`~/work/01-model-elevation-earth/`)
  are live at `labs.bannister.us/projects/<id>/` using exactly this pattern.
